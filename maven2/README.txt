The files in this directory are patches related to http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSUREFIRE-134.

These local patches include changes made to the surefire/maven-surefire-plugin repositories that set the
versions to 2.8-SNAPSHOT, which is a ridiculously high number in hopes of elminating future conflicts. (until
this issue is resolved.)

You should be able to apply these patches to the current (as of 7/29/06) trunk versions of the surefire and 
maven-surefire-plugin repositories.

ping jesse if you have any questions ( jkuhnert@gmail.com )
