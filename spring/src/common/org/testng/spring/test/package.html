Superclasses for tests requiring Spring application contexts,
including support for transactional execution of test cases,
with automatic rollback on completion.
Useful as base classes for application-specific tests.
<br/>
The superclasses in this package are ideal for integration testing. 
<i>Unit</i> testing should not normally involve the Spring container,
but should test classes in isolation.
